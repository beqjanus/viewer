             Linden Lab GLTF Implementation
 
 
 Currently in prototype stage.  Much functionality is missing (blend shapes, 
 multiple texture coordinates, etc).

 GLTF Specification can be found here: https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html
 If this implementation disagrees with the GLTF Specification, the specification is correct.

 Class structure and naming should match the GLTF Specification as closely as possible while
 conforming to the LL coding standards.  All code in headers should be contained in the 
 LL::GLTF namespace.

 The implementation serves both the client and the server.
